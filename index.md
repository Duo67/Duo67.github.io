# Biography

I am currently an associate professor in the Faculty of Information Technology at Beijing University of Technology (BJUT) since November 2023. I obtained my Ph.D. in Computer Science from Beijing University of Technology in June 2020. My research interests are in the general areas of machine learning, data mining and brain science, with a current focus on developing novel techniques to learn the brain effective connectivity networks from neuroimaging data.
